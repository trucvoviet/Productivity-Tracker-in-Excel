# 📊 Excel Habit Tracker – Full Build Summary

This lecture demonstrates how to build a **fully dynamic Habit Tracker in Excel** that helps users stay accountable by tracking habits daily, visualizing progress, and surfacing meaningful insights through charts and KPIs.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of the Habit Tracker

The Habit Tracker allows you to:

* List habits vertically
* Track daily completion using checkboxes
* Automatically calculate daily and habit-level progress
* Visualize completion trends over time
* Identify best and worst habits
* Monitor consistency with KPI metrics

The final result is a **dashboard-style habit tracker** built entirely in Excel—no add-ins required.

> Example outputs of the completed tracker.

## 🧱 Step 1: Building the Tracker Structure

### Habit List

* Habits are listed vertically starting around row 13.
* Example habits:

  * Daily Exercise
  * Read 10 Pages
  * Meditate
  * Drink Water
  * Journal

You can add more or fewer habits as needed.

---

### Date Sequence (21-Day Tracker)

To track habits across a fixed period (e.g. 21 days), use:

```excel
=SEQUENCE(,21)
```

This generates 21 consecutive day numbers across columns.

---

### Dynamic Start Date

Add a **Habit Start Date** cell, for example:

```text
01/01/2025
```

Each date column references the previous one:

```excel
=PreviousCell + 1
```

Drag across to fill all 21 days.

---

### Display Weekday Names Only

Convert dates into weekday labels:

* Select all date cells
* Open **Format Cells**
* Choose **Custom**
* Use:

```text
ddd
```

This displays: Mon, Tue, Wed, etc.

---

### Weekly Grouping (Optional)

* Label Week 1, Week 2, Week 3 above the date columns
* Merge and center each weekly block for readability

---

## ☑️ Step 2: Adding Habit Checkboxes

### Insert Checkboxes

1. Select the entire habit grid
2. Go to **Insert → Checkbox**

> If checkboxes are unavailable, you can use `"X"` instead.

---

### Checkbox Formatting

* Reduce checkbox font size (≈ 10)
* Change checkbox color to **green**
* Align checkboxes centrally

---

## 🎨 Formatting Enhancements

* Header background: dark blue
* Header text: white & bold
* Center all header labels
* Reduce column width (≈ 4.1)
* Hide gridlines for a dashboard look

---

## 📈 Step 3: Daily Progress Calculations

### Tasks Completed Per Day

Counts how many habits were completed on a given day:

```excel
=COUNTIF(HabitRange,TRUE)
```

> If using `"X"` instead of checkboxes:

```excel
=COUNTIF(HabitRange,"X")
```

---

### Daily Completion Percentage

```excel
=CompletedTasks / COUNTA(HabitList)
```

Format as **Percentage** and drag across all days.

---

## 📊 Step 4: Daily Completion Chart

### Create Line Chart

* Select the daily completion percentages
* Insert → **Line Chart with Markers**
* Remove gridlines
* Remove chart border
* Set Y-axis max to `1` (100%)

---

### Chart Styling

* Line color: green
* Marker size: ~6
* Enable **Smooth Line**
* Set background to match header color

The chart updates automatically as checkboxes are ticked.

---

## 📊 Step 5: Habit-Level Progress Bars

### Total Completions per Habit

```excel
=COUNTIF(DayRange,TRUE)
```

Drag down for all habits.

---

### Visual Progress Bar (Text-Based)

```excel
=REPT("|", TotalCompleted * 4)
```

Formatting tips:

* Font: **Playbill**
* Font color: dark green
* Increase column width for better visibility

Hide the numeric column and display only the bar.

---

## 🏆 Step 6: Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### Best Habit

```excel
=XLOOKUP(
  MAX(TotalCompletedRange),
  TotalCompletedRange,
  HabitNameRange
)
```

Returns the habit completed most frequently.

---

### Worst Habit

```excel
=XLOOKUP(
  MIN(TotalCompletedRange),
  TotalCompletedRange,
  HabitNameRange
)
```

Returns the least consistent habit.

---

## 📊 Step 7: Consistency KPIs (Right Panel)

### Days with 100% Completion

```excel
=COUNTIF(CompletionPercentRange,"100%")
```

---

### Days with >50% Completion

```excel
=COUNTIF(CompletionPercentRange,">50%")
```

---

### Days with 0% Completion

```excel
=COUNTIF(CompletionPercentRange,"0%")
```

---

### Custom Display Format

Format KPI numbers as:

```text
0" days"
```

Examples:

* `2 days`
* `8 days`

---

## 🎨 Final Polishing

* Alternate background colors per week
* Hide helper rows by matching font color to background
* Adjust chart Y-axis max to `1.1` to prevent cutoff
* Align everything visually for dashboard clarity

---

## ✅ Final Outcome

By the end, you have:

* A **fully dynamic habit tracker**
* Daily and habit-level analytics
* Automatic charts and KPIs
* A reusable template for any habit set or timeframe

All built using **native Excel features only**.
